3D Rotating Cube in C++ (CLI Mode) using Rotation Matrices
This C++ program simulates a 3D rotating cube in the terminal using ASCII characters. It leverages rotation matrices to transform the cube dynamically in 3D space and projects it onto a 2D plane for visualization.

Key Features:
 -> 3D Rotation using Matrices: Applies rotation matrices around the X, Y, and Z axes for smooth transformations.
 ->ASCII Rendering: Uses different characters ($,* ,#, @,-,+) to create a sense of depth.
 ->Perspective Projection: Simulates real 3D depth by projecting points onto a 2D plane.
 ->Double Buffering: Reduces flickering and enhances smoothness in terminal output.
 ->Trigonometric Calculations: Uses sin() and cos() functions for rotation transformations.
 ->Cross-Platform: Works in Windows, Linux, and macOS terminals.
